By making full use of technology and skills, we can improve our lives. \u2013 LHL","story":null},{"created_time":"2012-05-15T15:18:57.000Z","id":"125845680811480_357948324267880","message":"My previous post on the call centres in the Philippines attracted many thoughtful comments, which I have read with great interest.\n\nAs several readers pointed out (e.g. Aaron Quek, Eric Lee, Melvin Chen), I was not suggesting that Singapore should aim to attract call centre jobs, or compete with the Philippines on the basis of low wages. We have gone well past that phase of development. Furthermore, our fundamental aim is to improve the wages of our workers, not join in a race to the bottom. My point was that many jobs which used to be done in the developed countries are gradually migrating to lower-cost providers around the world, such as call centres in the Philippines. This global trend will affect us too.\n\nThe Filipinos will not stop at call centres. They are already moving on higher value-added services such as animation for movies and video games. India has upgraded from running call centres to hosting higher-end business process outsourcing (BPOs), e.g. providing professional services such as legal advice and filing tax returns for Americans, at a fraction of the cost of American lawyers and accountants. \n\nAs more and more services are \u201ccrowdsourced\u201d at the click of a mouse, Singaporean workers will face growing competition. Not just in unskilled and low-paid jobs, but white-collar jobs too; and not just from foreign workers here, but from workers and professionals thousands of miles away in other countries. \n\nThis is why, although we want our workers to earn more, we cannot simply push up Singaporean wages as we would like. Globalisation and technology make this impossible. We will watch the inflow of foreign workers, so that Singaporeans don\u2019t get overwhelmed. But in the long term, the only way for our workers to do better is to compete on knowledge and innovation, upgrade our skills, and stay ahead of the pack. We also have to continue welcoming talent, to boost our competitive edge.

Always happy to have the chance to thank those who keep our country safe and secure.\n \nThis year marks 45 years of NS. More than 900,000 men have completed this rite of passage, and NS has become a vital national institution.\n\nI remember when I was called up in 1971, and was a recruit in \u2018A\u2019 Company, 2 SIR, at Holland Road Camp. The facilities were basic, the equipment often incomplete. We did not even have steel helmets for everybody. We were issued only the inner liners covered with camouflage nets, except when we went to the firing range.\n\nWhen it came to my sons\u2019 turn to be called up, my wife and I went with them to BMTC at Pulau Tekong. I met many other parents, who had similarly done NS themselves. We (the fathers) all ooh\u2019d and aah\u2019d over the barrack rooms, the cupboards and mattresses, and of course the cookhouse food. We told our sons about the old days, but I am not sure how impressed they were.\n \nLong after we have finished NS, the bonds and friendships remain. Last Sunday, at the Singapore Youth Awards (SYA) Presentation Ceremony, someone came to say hello. He had served under me in 23 SA in 1980, as a gunner. Now he was on the SYA panel choosing the awardees. We were so happy to meet again.\n \nThank you to all our servicemen, regular and NS, for safeguarding our peace, security and progress! Thanks also to all the families and employers, for your support and understanding! \n\nHere\u2019s an old photo I dug out from my recruit days in 2 SIR, plus photos from today\u2019s parade. \n \n- LHL","story":"Lee Hsien Loong shared their album."},{"created_time":"2012-07-04T12:51:41.000Z","id":"125845680811480_386757108053668","message":"Maliki & me, with the youth leaders.

I\u2019m also going to Yingxiu Town, the epicentre of the May 2008 Wenchuan earthquake. The Sichuan government has done a tremendous job reconstructing the town and rebuilding the people\u2019s lives, and are very proud of the results.\nI\u2019m also going to Tianjin, to visit the Tianjin Eco-city. This is an important project for Singapore, which I look forward to seeing for the first time. \n\nIn Beijing I will be calling on Chinese leaders, including President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao. I am also speaking at the Central Party School (CPS), followed by Q&A. Many up and coming Chinese officials attend the CPS and I expect a lively exchange with them. \n\nFrom China, I will head to Vladivostok for the annual APEC meeting. This year Russia is hosting. Vladivostok is a port city on the Pacific Ocean at about the same latitude as Hokkaido in Japan.

The APEC meeting itself is taking place on Russky Island (just south of the Vladivostok mainland), a former naval base to protect Russia\u2019s Far East. \r\n\r\nThe Russians have made tremendous efforts to prepare Vladivostok for the APEC meeting. They built highways from the airport, two new bridges to Russky Island, and a whole new campus for a university, where we are staying and holding the APEC meeting. This is the view from my balcony at dawn \u2013 all the buildings you can see will belong to the Far Eastern Federal University. Hope you like the view! - LHL","story":null},{"created_time":"2012-09-09T14:34:00.000Z","id":"125845680811480_470545462976574","message":"Met my old friend Dr Lien Chan, Honorary Chairman of Kuomintang, and Mrs Lien for tea on the sidelines of the 20th APEC Economic Leaders\u2019 Meeting (AELM) in Vladivostok. \u2013 LHL\n\n\u6211\u4e0a\u5348\u5728\u4fc4\u7f57\u65af\u7b26\u62c9\u8fea\u6c83\u65af\u6258\u514b\uff08\u53c8\u79f0\u6d77\u53c2\u5d34\uff09\u8ddf\u6211\u7684\u8001\u670b\u53cb\u8fde\u6218\u535a\u58eb\u53ca\u5176\u592b\u4eba\u8336\u53d9\u3002\u8fde\u6218\u535a\u58eb\u662f\u56fd\u6c11\u515a\u8363\u8a89\u4e3b\u5e2d\uff0c\u4ed6\u4ee3\u8868\u53f0\u6e7e\u51fa\u5e2d\u4e9a\u592a\u7ecf\u5408\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5cf0\u4f1a\u3002\u2013 \u674e\u663e\u9f99","story":"Lee Hsien Loong shared their album."},{"created_time":"2012-09-09T23:58:05.000Z","id":"125845680811480_411184428944269","message":"Well done to all our Paralympians for their excellent performances at the London Paralympics, which closed earlier today.

Entitled \u201cSins of Their Founders\u201d, the piece reviews a book on the civil war in Sri Lanka. The civil war started in 1983, but as Dhume pointed out its roots go back to the country\u2019s independence in 1948. Instead of embracing an inclusive view of citizenship, Sri Lanka (then called Ceylon) marginalised the Tamil minority. The Tamil revolt was led by Velupillai Prabhakaran, a brutal guerrilla leader. The bloody conflict killed tens of thousands, and set the country back many years. Now that it is over, I hope Sri Lanka can enjoy lasting peace and stability.\n\nDhume noted that Singapore took a different path, with a different result. We are fortunate that right from the birth of our nation, our founders upheld multi-racialism and equal opportunity as the fundamental basis for our society. Thus we have maintained harmony between the different races and religions all these years. But we must never take this harmony as given, and must continue to work hard together to uphold and strengthen it. \u2013 LHL","story":null},{"created_time":"2012-09-30T00:17:33.000Z","id":"125845680811480_419013474828031","message":"Mid-Autumn Festival \/ \u5e86\u795d\u4e2d\u79cb\u8282\n\nA happy Mid-Autumn Festival to all!

Millions of Muslims have gathered in the holy city of Mecca. Unfortunately, this year Saudi Arabia accepted fewer pilgrims, as it is redeveloping the area around two Holy Mosques. Singapore\u2019s Haj quota was also reduced, even though I wrote to the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia to request more places. I hope that those who were unable to go this year will get the chance to do so before too long.\n\nMuslims also perform the Korban (sacrifice) today, to celebrate Prophet Ibrahim\u2019s faith in God. Min Yaacob Ibrahim and I were initially quite worried that our Korban ritual might be affected by Australia\u2019s stringent new regulations on live sheep exports. Fortunately 16 mosques passed the Australian audits, and were able to import 2,500 sheep for the ceremony. \n\nWhen I met Australian PM Julia Gillard in Canberra recently, I thanked her for her government\u2019s help on this matter. She told me that her government wants to continue exporting live animals. But I know that Australian animal welfare groups are pressing strongly to ban live exports completely, as New Zealand has done. We should be prepared for this possibility, and work out alternative arrangements in future.\n\nI wish all Muslims well during this holy day. \u2013 LHL\n\nSalam Aidiladha kepada semua umat Islam Singapura!\n\nSemasa musim haji ini, jutaan umat Islam dari seluruh dunia berkumpul di kota suci Mekah. Malangnya, tahun ini, kerajaan Arab Saudi menghadkan bilangan jemaah dari luar negara kerana projek pembangunan semula di kawasan Tanah Suci. Kuota haji Singapura juga turut terjejas, walaupun saya telah menulis kepada Putera Mahkota Arab Saudi untuk merayu kuota tambahan. Saya berharap bahawa mereka yang tidak dapat menunaikan haji mereka tahun ini akan mendapat peluang untuk berbuat demikian tidak lama lagi.\n\nHari ini juga umat Islam mengerjakan korban untuk memperingati ketaatan Nabi Ibrahim kepada Tuhan. Saya dan Menteri Yaacob Ibrahim pada mulanya khuatir ibadah korban akan terjejas tahun ini sempena peraturan pemerintah Australia yang lebih ketat ke atas eksport binatang. Mujurlah, 16 masjid lulus pemeriksaan audit Australia dan berjaya mengimport 2,500 ekor kambing untuk dikorbankan.\n\nKetika bertemu PM Australia Julia Gillard di Canberra baru-baru ini, saya mengucapkan terima kasih kepada beliau atas bantuan pemerintah beliau mengenai perkara ini. Dia memberitahu saya bahawa pemerintah Australia mahu terus mengeksport ternakan hidup. Namun, saya tahu bahawa kumpulan-kumpulan hak asasi haiwan telah menggesa pemerintah Australia supaya mengharam sepenuhnya eksport ternakan hidup seperti apa yang dilakukan oleh New Zealand. Kita perlu bersedia menghadapi kemungkinan ini dan mencari alternatif jika ia berlaku.\n\nSaya ingin mengucapkan yang terbaik bagi semua umat Islam pada hari suci ini. \u2013 LHL","story":null},{"created_time":"2012-10-27T05:09:25.000Z","id":"125845680811480_429788347083877","message":"Happy to launch the 2012 National Healthy Lifestyle Campaign at Gardens by the Bay this morning.

We compiled a profile of all the MPS cases we handled in Teck Ghee over the last year, which I thought you might find interesting. \r\n\r\nIn 2012, we served nearly 2,800 residents (many of whom came more than once) and wrote over 5,500 letters of appeal, or more than 100 letters per week. Just under half the cases live in Teck Ghee itself, while the rest were from other parts of Ang Mo Kio GRC. More than half were older residents (aged 46 or older). Half live in 3-room flats, mirroring the housing profile of our estate. But I had a sprinkling (3%) from private estates too \u2013 these residents are generally able to handle problems themselves, though once in a while they too find they need their MP.\r\n\r\nThe most frequent appeals (more than a third) concerned housing, e.g. buying\/selling flats or requests for rental flats. HDB has a tough job, but it is making progress building more BTO flats and shortening waiting times for rental flats. \r\n\r\nOther common appeals were for financial assistance (14%, including social assistance, or help with paying bills), followed by immigration matters (12%, including citizenship & PR, employment or social visit passes), and traffic\/parking issues (9% of letters, mostly appealing against summonses). Education appeals (4%) popped up seasonally, especially during school or university \/ poly \/ ITE admissions season. \r\n\r\nFortunately, we encountered not many requests for help to find jobs (3%) reflecting our low unemployment. Nor were there were many requests for help with medical bills (only 82 cases throughout the whole year, less than 2%), though I know that people worry a lot about healthcare costs and we will continue to monitor them closely. \r\n\r\nWe always seek to give residents a full and sympathetic hearing, and to help them as best as we can. Even if we can\u2019t fully solve all their problems, we can often at least lessen them. I always feel encouraged when residents come to thank us, like this one who brought me a special thank you card.

It was a special occasion, because both have been with GIC since it was first formed in 1981. They have contributed much to Singapore \u2013 overseeing and managing our reserves through booms and crashes, growing them steadily year by year, and mentoring generations of younger officers. \r\n\r\nRichard was the first private sector member of the GIC Board. After he retired from Shell Singapore, he became the Managing Director of GIC (and MAS concurrently), before serving as Finance Minister. He continued serving on the GIC Board even after he retired from politics.

Let\u2019s stand together to build in Singapore a brighter future for all.\n \nHappy National Day! - LHL\n\n#nationalday","story":null},{"created_time":"2013-08-08T13:19:30.000Z","id":"125845680811480_558167904245920","message":"You can also watch the National Day Messages in Mandarin, Malay and Tamil on the PMO YouTube channel. \n \nMandarin: http:\/\/bit.ly\/14AazQa\nMalay: http:\/\/bit.ly\/19dppxy\nTamil: http:\/\/bit.ly\/15QpEfI \n\n#nationalday","story":null},{"created_time":"2013-08-09T00:06:11.000Z","id":"125845680811480_558358234226887","message":"Celebrating 9 August - Blk 418 in Teck Ghee. \r\n\r\n#nationalday\r\n\r\n(MCI Photo by Terence Tan)","story":"Lee Hsien Loong updated their cover photo."},{"created_time":"2013-08-09T05:05:34.000Z","id":"125845680811480_558491427546901","message":"Happy National Day!

As I said in my ND Message, Singapore is at a turning point and needs to find a new way forward together. The economy is maturing and our population is ageing. Different groups in society have more diverse, even conflicting, interests. Older people worry about healthcare and costs of living. Younger ones aspire to wider education opportunities and more affordable homes. So we need to reassess our position, review our direction, and refresh our strategies. We have already started adjusting policies to achieve our goal: a fair and just society. \n\nHere are some videos on the changes in housing, education and healthcare.

We owe it to them to do so, just as we owe what we have today to our founding generation. PM said his responsibility is to help our young build the Singapore of their dreams: A Singapore with Opportunities, Purpose, Assurance, Community Spirit and Trust, a home where we celebrate our many talents, and above all, a society where the human spirit flourishes.\r\n\r\nTo realise these dreams, we need to do tangible things to build our city and improve our living environment. We are upgrading Changi Airport with a new complex codenamed Project Jewel, two new terminals and a fourth runway, to maintain our position as an international hub and create more opportunities for Singaporeans in future. We will move Paya Lebar Airbase to Changi. This will free up a big plot of land (bigger than Bishan or Ang Mo Kio) for new homes, offices, factories, parks and more in Paya Lebar. Relocating the airbase will also remove height restrictions on a large area around Paya Lebar, and allow us to redevelop eastern Singapore in new and exciting ways. The Government is also building a new port in Tuas and will move all container ports from Tanjong Pagar there eventually. This will free up prime land in Tanjong Pagar for a brand new Southern Waterfront City.\r\n \r\nPM said these longer-term plans reflect our fundamental mindset and spirit \u2013 to be confident, to look ahead, to aim high. He said if we can carry off these plans, we will not have to worry about running out of space or possibilities in Singapore. We are creating possibilities and opportunities for the future, for our children and theirs to continue building, upgrading and reinventing our city for many more years. \r\n\r\n#ndrsg\r\n\r\n(Photo courtesy of Changi Airport)","story":"Lee Hsien Loong with Nik Rose."},{"created_time":"2013-08-18T13:54:34.000Z","id":"125845680811480_562952703767440","message":"In his conclusion, PM said that all these are not merely plans but acts of faith \u2013 in Singapore and in ourselves: that a generation from now, Singapore will still be here; that we can thrive in the world and hold our own against bigger and stronger competitors; that we can get our politics right and have honest, capable, trusted people to lead our country well; that we can stay together as one united people and make our dreams come true.\r\n\r\nPM called on Singaporeans to work with him and with one another. \u201cTogether, let us forge our new way forward, to create a better Singapore for all of us.\u201d\r\n\r\n#ndrsg\r\n\r\n(Photo courtesy of Mr Jimmy Chan)","story":"Lee Hsien Loong with Dimaz Wahyu."},{"created_time":"2013-08-18T13:59:25.000Z","id":"125845680811480_562955693767141","message":"The National Day Rally is over.

They are too many to answer individually, but I want to address some of the key themes.\n\nMany tweeted about stress in the education system (e.g. @Joshyy_Tingg, @RovinNation, @ShaeAtSix). Richard Chan and Benny Chee wrote about the need to do more in terms of values, ethics and social awareness. I understand these concerns. But we do need to study and work hard, to give ourselves the best start in life. We are making every school a good school, and providing every student with many paths through the education system. But there is a lot of competition to get into the most popular schools. Some competition is good, but too much becomes counter-productive. \n\nStudents, parents and teachers must not lose sight of what education is about. Yesterday, Heng Swee Keat outlined MOE\u2019s plans to continue providing values-driven, holistic education, to help every student achieve success in his own way, at his own pace (http:\/\/bit.ly\/1bFvVO3). But whether this reduces stress depends also on our attitudes towards success and examinations. \n\nSeveral of you worried about housing affordability (e.g., @ZeeFriday, Zack Drz, Siu Lin). Housing is becoming more affordable, because we have increased grants for lower- and middle-income families, and are building more flats. We will track this closely and do more if necessary to keep HDB flats always within reach of Singaporeans.\n\n@hpility asked if being Prime Minister is stressful. I suppose sometimes it is, just like any other job. But it is a great honour for me to serve.

This evening I met community and religious leaders, together with some Ministers and MPs, for a candid and fruitful dialogue. Snapped this pic of the participants at the end \u2013 all in good spirits! \n\nI told the group that I fully appreciate their desire to allow Muslim women in uniform to wear the tudung. But a larger issue is at stake: the sort of society we aspire to be. Singapore is a multi-racial, multi-religious and harmonious society. Minorities are fully integrated into the mainstream, but have full opportunities to maintain their identities and practise their faiths. So I am also mindful how crucial it is for us to strengthen our cohesion, and maintain the relaxed confidence and trust that benefits us all, especially the minorities.\n\nOn the tudung issue, the position is not frozen. Attitudes will shift and arrangements will get updated. We have gradually evolved over the last decade. Many statutory boards now have uniforms that allow Muslim staff to wear the tudung, e.g., LTA, NEA. In 5, 10 years\u2019 time, I am confident that we will not be in the same situation as today.\n\nIt is best that we continue evolving gradually and carefully. The racial harmony we enjoy is not perfect, but it is more precious and more fragile than we think. Let\u2019s work hard to strengthen it, so that all races can live happily together as one united people. \u2013 LHL\n\nIsu tudung adalah isu penting bagi ramai orang Islam di Singapura. Petang tadi saya dan beberapa Menteri serta Anggota Parlimen telah bertemu dengan wakil-wakil masyarakat dan pemimpin agama. Perbincangan kami berlangsung secara terus terang, dan dari hati ke hati. Lihat gambar para peserta yang saya petik di akhir sesi \u2013 semuanya dalam semangat muhibbah! \n\nSaya tekankan kepada para peserta bahawa saya akur hasrat mereka untuk membenarkan wanita Islam di sektor seragam memakai tudung. Tetapi isu lebih besar harus difikirkan: Apakah bentuk masyarakat yang kita inginkan? \n\nSingapura adalah sebuah masyarakat berbilang bangsa dan agama yang harmoni. Kaum minoriti sebati dengan masyarakat lebih besar tetapi memiliki peluang sepenuhnya untuk kekalkan identiti dan amalkan agama masing-masing. Jadi saya sedar betapa gentingnya untuk memperkukuh ikatan kita bersama dan mengekalkan keyakinan dan kepercayaan yang mendatangkan manfaat untuk kita semua, lebih-lebih lagi kaum minoriti.\n\nDalam isu tudung, keadaan yang kita lihat hari ini tidak akan kekal begini. Sikap akan berubah dan dikemaskinikan. Sepanjang sedekad lalu, ada kemajuan yang bertahap dalam isu ini. Kini, banyak badan berkanun membenarkan kakitangan mereka memakai tudung bersama pakaian seragam misalnya LTA, NEA. Dalam 5, 10 tahun lagi, saya yakin keadaan akan berubah, tidak seperti hari ini. \n\nSebaiknya kita terus bergerak secara bertahap dan berhati-hati. Sesungguhnya keharmonian kaum yang kita nikmati tidak sempurna, ia sebenarnya lebih rapuh dan berharga dari apa yang kita sedari. \n\nAyuh kita berusaha gigih untuk memperkukuhkannya supaya semua kaum boleh hidup bersama-sama dengan selesa sebagai satu warga yang bersatu-padu. - LHL","story":null},{"created_time":"2014-01-26T02:12:33.000Z","id":"125845680811480_650373518358691","message":"PM Lee Hsien Loong bercakap kepada media di akhir sesi dialog dengan wakil masyarakat Melayu\/Islam mengenai isu tudung pada 25 Januari 2014.","story":null},{"created_time":"2014-01-26T06:03:25.000Z","id":"125845680811480_650455971683779","message":"PM Lee Hsien Loong speaking to the media, after his dialogue with Malay\/Muslim community leaders on the tudung issue, on 25 January 2014.","story":null},{"created_time":"2014-01-27T13:14:44.000Z","id":"125845680811480_651205488275494","message":"How time flies!

Take for example the crisis in Ukraine, which Minister K Shanmugam Sc talked about in his speech yesterday (http:\/\/bit.ly\/1e1SDg7). \n\nUkraine is bigger than Singapore, but much smaller than its neighbour, Russia. For the last few months, the country has been in turmoil. Two weeks ago, President Yanukovich fled, and his pro-Russian government collapsed.

We condemn any unprovoked invasion of a sovereign country, whatever the pretext. All countries, big and small, must observe international law. This is vital to a small country like Singapore. \n\nRussia is a nuclear power. Ukraine signed a treaty in 1994 with Russia, the US and UK to give up its nuclear weapons, in exchange for which the US and Russia agreed not to use force against Ukraine. Yet Ukraine is in this predicament today. \n\nThe Ukraine crisis reminds us that small countries must defend themselves, and cannot rely solely on international treaties or the promises of others. That is why we must always maintain a strong SAF and Home Team. We must also have a capable MFA to strengthen our ties with friends and allies.

People are using English words in spoken and written Chinese directly, without translating them into Chinese equivalents, or even transliterating them into similar sounding Chinese characters.  It is easier to say GDP than \u56fd\u5185\u751f\u4ea7\u603b\u503c, and Wifi is Wifi. \n\nThis is causing controversy in China. Some think it is the practical thing to do \u2013 everybody knows what Wifi is, so why invent some unfamiliar Chinese term for the same thing? But others feel that the pure Chinese language is being polluted with foreign words. After all, some translations have been successful \u2013 Coca Cola \u53ef\u53e3\u53ef\u4e50 has a very appropriate meaning, and translating email into \u7535\u90ae is neat and succinct.\n\nThe same thing is happening to other languages too. If you listen to Malay spoken in Malaysia, or Tamil in India, you will often hear English words mixed in.\n\nThe reality is that a language is a live, changing thing. It constantly absorbs words, concepts and usages from foreign languages, so long as people are using it in their daily lives. Otherwise it becomes a dead language, studied by scholars but not spoken by ordinary people anymore, like Latin or Sanskrit.\n\nWe pay a lot of attention to languages in Singapore. We are doing our utmost to keep our mother tongues alive. These are live languages to be used, so we should accept that they will evolve and change over time.

NJCians have contributed to nation-building over the last four decades.  Some of my classmates are moving into the third age of their lives, becoming grandparents, enjoying retirement and giving time and energy to good causes. \n \nAs the first junior college in Singapore, NJC had to overcome many challenges.

You could say I was a \u201cpioneer generation\u201d too (although the NJC pioneer students don\u2019t qualify for the PGP)! :)\n\nNJC exemplifies our efforts to keep paths upwards open to all, and to promote an open and egalitarian society. The college actively seeks out talented students from humble backgrounds, and has no affiliations to primary or secondary schools. It promotes a culture of moderation and restraint, so all students and staff feel comfortable and interact on equal terms with one another. \n \nI wish NJC the very best.

Hundreds of people have been killed, mostly civilians, including many children and infants. The loss of innocent lives is tragic and painful. The Middle East is far away, but still we empathise with the pain and suffering of the Palestinian people, because of our common humanity.\n \nAlas there is no easy solution. The Israel-Palestinian problem goes back almost a century. The distrust and enmity are mutual, and deep.

I hope all parties will work together to stop this latest episode of violence. \n \nLet's keep the victims of the ongoing conflict in our thoughts and prayers.

Masalah Israel-Palestin berakar umbi hampir seabad lamanya. Mereka saling tidak mempercayai dan permusuhan begitu mendalam. Lingkaran keganasan dan tindak balas yang tiada penghujung tidak menjanjikan masa depan yang baik untuk rakyat. \n\nSebarang huraian jangka panjang mesti bermula dengan kedua-dua pihak menghentikan keganasan. Saya harap semua pihak bekerjasama untuk akhiri gelombang keganasan terbaru ini. \n\nMarilah kita sama-sama mendoakan kesejahteraan mangsa-mangsa konflik yang sedang berlaku ini.

Tetapi mereka memilih untuk jatuh-bangun bersama Singapura sehingga negara ini mekar menjadi sebuah masyarakat berbilang kaum dan agama yang unik \u2013 yang bersatu padu dan harmoni. Beliau mengulangi penghargaannya kepada golongan Perintis Melayu kerana yakin dengan masa depan Singapura dan bertungkus-lumus dengan kaum lain, membangunkan Singapura.\n\nSalah seorang tokoh Perintis Melayu cemerlang yang disebut PM ialah Encik Yusof Ishak, Presiden pertama Singapura. PM mengumumkan 3 bentuk penghargaan sebagai menjunjung budi dan pengorbanan Encik Yusof kepada Negara:\n\nPertama, sebuah masjid baru di Woodlands akan dinamakan \u201cMasjid Yusof Ishak\u201d.\n\nKedua, Institut Pengajian Asia Tenggara bakal dikenali sebagai \u201cISEAS \u2013 Institut Yusof Ishak\u201d. \n\nKetiga, NUS akan memulakan \u201cKerusi Profesor Yusof Ishak dalam Sains Sosial\u201d. \n\nDalam ucapannya, PM turut menarik perhatian tentang kemajuan besar yang dicatat masyarakat Melayu\/Islam sepanjang 50 tahun lalu. Ini ketara melalui contoh-contoh individu Melayu\/Islam yang berjaya saban tahun. \n\nPM juga menarik perhatian tentang penekanan pemerintah untuk menghargai setiap individu berdasarkan sumbangannya dan bukan hanya kelayakannya. PM mengumumkan pembentukan Jawatankuasa ASPIRE yang akan bantu rakyat menggilap potensi mereka melalui pembelajaran sepanjang hayat dan latihan kemahiran khususnya buat pelajar ITE dan politeknik. Ini agar setiap rakyat berpeluang untuk majukan diri dan perbaiki kehidupan mereka.\n\nMenggulung ucapannya, PM yakin masyarakat Melayu\/Islam akan mencatat kejayaan demi kejayaan jika mereka terus bersatu-padu. PM menyeru agar masyarakat Melayu\/Islam menjunjung semangat golongan Perintis, perkukuh masyarakat berbilang kaum kita dan memperteguh komitmen untuk membentuk Singapura yang lebih baik buat semua.

In 1961, Mr Lee Kuan Yew gave 12 radio talks, telling the inside story of the fight between the non-Communists and Communists, and explaining to Singaporeans what was at stake. Later he published the talks as a book, The Battle for Merger. The book has just been republished; hence the exhibition.\n\nThe radio talks were a crucial move in winning the hearts and minds of the people. It led to Singapore joining Malaysia, then Separation and today\u2019s independent Singapore. Had Mr Lee and the non-Communist side lost, our history would have been totally different. \n\nMr Lee worked very very hard to write and deliver the talks. I remember the \u201cfamily holiday\u201d in Cameron Highlands in August 1961, which we took so that my father could compose the talks away from the day to day pressures in Singapore. His secretary came with us, and there were multiple drafts and redrafts all over the flat in Cluny Lodge. \n\nI also remember following my father to Radio Singapore to record the talks. He broadcast 12 talks, in 3 languages, making a total of 36 broadcasts in just one month. Now that I have done my own talks and speeches, and know how much work goes into a single short broadcast, e.g. the National Day Message, I understand what a superhuman effort this was.\n\nThe subject was serious, but Mr Lee presented it simply and vividly. Singaporeans listened to the broadcasts eagerly. When the book came out, I read it, fascinated. I still have my old copy. It still reads like a thriller today.\n\nAfter more than 50 years, Singapore has changed enormously, and vastly for the better. Most of today\u2019s Singaporeans were born long after the broadcasts.

This was the book of Mr Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s radio talks in 1961, explaining what the fight against the Communists was about, and why Singapore needed Merger with Malaya. \n\nThe Communist Party of Malaya (CPM) was a violent, illegal organisation. So it operated secretly, underground. But the Communists infiltrated open, legal organisations like trade unions, student associations and political parties. These supported the Communist cause, but denied that they themselves were Communist. Mr Lee exposed this Communist united front tactic.\n\nI took these photos of a fascinating exhibit: a pair of original handwritten documents. One was a trade union document, signed \u6797\u6e05\u7965 Lim Chin Siong. He was the leader of the Barisan Sosialis, the main open front political party. The other was a Communist study cell document, signed \u738b\u660e Wang Ming. The handwriting was identical. In fact Wang Ming was Lim Chin Siong\u2019s party name; Communist cadres took party names to conceal their real identities. So Lim Chin Siong was a Communist, and the Barisan Sosialis was Communist controlled.\n\nThis was more than 50 years ago. Many old Communist and pro-Communist activists have reconciled with their past, and become good citizens. But a few hard core ones still deny these historical facts. They don\u2019t want to admit that they had fought on the wrong side, and that luckily for Singapore they lost. Some \u201crevisionist\u201d historians make this argument too. One motivation: cast doubt on the legitimacy of the PAP government, not just in the 1960s, but today.\n\nThe British have been declassifying documents from their archives in London, and making them available to the public. Also senior CPM leaders like Chin Peng, Eu Chooi Yip, Fong Chong Pik (aka the Plen) and others have published memoirs. Their first person accounts, like the British documents, confirm the extent of the Communist united front in Singapore, and leave no doubt that the Barisan was formed at the instigation of the CPM, and that Lim Chin Siong was a Communist cadre.\n\nWe have put together an account using evidence from the British archives as well as CPM sources, which confirm that Mr Lee Kuan Yew told the truth.

This was not because her high score of 261 allowed her entry into any school of her choice, but because she had already made up her mind to apply for Evergreen Secondary School, a neighbourhood school that was next to her home.\n \nThis time last year, Wei Ling\u2019s teachers and school mates thought she was \u201cwasting\u201d her chances but both she and her father, Mr Goh Poh Ling, a 68-year old taxi driver, thought it was a \u201cworthwhile\u201d choice.\n \nMr Goh said that his daughter could have gone to any school, but this one was the closest to home, and thus the most suitable. \u201cIf she went to a school further away, the journey there would have taken at least one hour, and a return trip would be two hours. That would have amounted to 730 hours in a year. Who would find the time to do their school work?\u201d \n \nFrom her home in Woodlands Street 83, Wei Ling, who is now in Secondary One, takes just 5 minutes to walk to school everyday. The time she saves on traveling is spent on school work and with her family. \u201cLights out\u201d is at 9.30pm and her family life is disciplined and healthy. \n \nWei Ling said, \u201cRather than a school\u2019s name or reputation, what matters more to my parents are good moral values. Every day, I spend most of my time with my family, and not on travelling. Ever since I was in Primary Four, I had already wanted to attend Evergreen and it is better than what I imagined.\u201d\n \nWei Ling\u2019s elder brother graduated from Evergreen, and was the school\u2019s head prefect. He did well in his \u2018O\u2019 Levels, scoring eight A1s. Mr Goh related with pride how his children did not receive any tuition, as he could neither afford the fees nor the time. \u201cFor me, nothing is more important than a good upbringing, and the neighbourhood schools are not bad. If the child works hard, they can achieve good results, too. I am not from the Ministry of Education, but I believe that every school is a good school.\u201d \n \nBrand name schools are attractive, but in the eyes of Mr Goh, what is more important is the sort of environment that suits the child. \n \n\u201cIf the child has the ability, they can go anywhere. Brand name schools are good, but the competition there is also strong. You may be first elsewhere, but be pushed down by the tougher environment. As parents, we should not let our children feel belittled. Instead, let them feel empowered. I will not insist that my children become doctors. Whatever she chooses to do, I will support as long as her heart is set on it.\u201d\n \nWei Ling added that while many people may feel that neighbourhood schools are not as good, she disagrees. \u201cI like Evergreen Secondary School very much and I have learnt a lot about life and being a better person here.\u201d\n \nParent wants his child to be less tired\n \nSiti Nurjaslina Bte Jeffry, 13, also performed well at last year\u2019s PSLE. She chose to go to Fuhua Secondary School. Not only is it near her home, she was also attracted to their shooting CCA.\n \nEven though she did not make it to the CCA, Siti was not disappointed as there were many other interesting CCAs she could choose from, and she now enjoys being part of the Malay Cultural Group. \n \nSiti\u2019s father, Mr Jufri, a 44-year-old technician, said, \u201cLife is already stressful in Singapore. I hope my children will not be too stressed. Her results could have gotten her into a brand name school, but she will be very tired. I don\u2019t want her to be worn out. When you are under pressure, it will also be difficult to make friends and enjoy their friendship.\u201d","story":null},{"created_time":"2014-12-22T10:01:19.000Z","id":"125845680811480_825151044214270","message":"Ho Ho Ho!

It is a time to reflect on the blessings of having a family \u2013 to thank our elders for what they have done for us, to appreciate our spouses, to shower love on our children. It is a time to enjoy the simple goodness of family.   \n\nSo even if we may be busy, travelling or living in far flung lands, unable to come together physically for the New Year reunion, let us make the effort to connect with one another. On this most important festival in the lunar calendar, let us pause and remind ourselves of what truly matters in life, of what it means to belong to a family.   \n\nThe Government is doing all it can to help people build strong families. We are encouraging couples to have more children. The Marriage and Parenthood Package will support them, as will more affordable childcare and pre-schools. This year, we look forward to celebrating the birth of many Jubilee babies. We are encouraging three-generation families to stay close-knit, and making it easier for young couples setting up home to live close to their parents, through targeted housing grants. The Pioneer Generation Package, Silver Support and MediShield Life will lighten the burden on families taking care of elderly parents.  \n\nBeyond our immediate family and relatives, we should also strengthen our larger national family. Singaporeans need to take care of one another, and especially of fellow citizens who are vulnerable or less fortunate.  We are strengthening our social safety nets. We have made it easier for low-income families to own their homes, introduced MediShield Life to give more protection against large hospital bills, reviewed CPF Life to help families better prepare for retirement, and expanded Workfare to support low-income workers and their families. The state and the community are bearing more risk on behalf of individuals, to give those who need help more peace of mind.  We are all in this together.  \n\nWe are doing all this to help our families stay together, not to supplant the role that families play. Our family ties must not weaken, unlike what we have seen in other societies where the state has taken on more responsibility. We must not let this happen in Singapore \u2013 either to our individual families, or to our larger national family. \n\nStrong families are the bedrock of our society. Family members not only take care of each other. They laugh and cry together.  Every member is shaped by every other. Our families inspire us to be better, not just for ourselves but for each other. Our families are always there for us, in sickness and in health, for better or for worse.\n\nGenerous social policies and grants by themselves do not grow strong or happy families. A family is not just about whom we are related to, but how we relate to each other. Therefore, let us make the effort to build strong families \u2013 to spend time with each other, nurture our children, respect and care for our elderly parents, and through our deeds help those in

We want Singaporeans to have greater assurance at each stage of life, more opportunities and a better home for all. \n\nWe will invest continuously in every citizen, and empower you to learn throughout your life, so that you can become expert in your chosen field of work. \n\nWe will invest heavily in infrastructure to create a highly liveable home with quality healthcare. \n\nWe will provide additional support to Singaporean families for your costs of living and your retirement.  \n\nGovernment spending will increase, so we are also making sure that we have enough revenues. One thing we will do is to raise personal income taxes for the top 5% of income earners. \n\nMore details on the various initiatives will be shared during the Committee of Supply, which will start on 3 March.

NMP Chia Yong Yong made an excellent speech about the CPF. I was not in the chamber to hear her, but watched it later on YouTube. \n\nYong Yong cast the question in a broader perspective: whether it is right to think of the CPF as \u201cour money\u201d, to be spent solely as we choose. She explained how choice always comes with responsibility, and benefits always carry obligations. When we exercise personal choice (e.g. by spending our CPF savings early), there is a price to be paid (e.g. we may not have enough to support ourselves in old age), and that price should not be paid by someone else (e.g. other taxpayers).\n\nYong Yong had asked me earlier whether we had settled the CPF policy, and if so was it worth her while to speak. I said we had worked out the main changes, but strongly encouraged her to express her view and contribute to the public debate. I am glad that she did, and to such good effect.\n\nHere\u2019s an excerpt of her speech.

When my father died a fortnight ago, Bernard wrote to me. I was moved.

I said that we each have to make our journey through life, and live it so that when it is complete, we can say with good conscience that we have done our part.

Someone asked me for it. Here is the source code, the exe file, and a sample printout - http:\/\/bit.ly\/1zAXbua\n\nThe program is pretty basic: it runs at the command prompt, in a DOS window. Type in the data line by line (e.g. 1-3-8---6), then the solver will print out the solution (or all the solutions if there are several), the number of steps the program took searching for the solution, plus some search statistics.\n\nFor techies: the program does a backtrack search, choosing the next cell to guess which minimises the fanout.\n\nHere\u2019s a question for those reading the source code: if x is an (binary) integer, what does (x & -x) compute?\n\nHope you have fun playing with this.

This assumes two\u2019s complement notation for negative numbers, as some of you also pointed out. e.g. if x=12 (binary 1100), then (x & -x) = 4 (binary 100).

Our political system is working now. But we must keep updating it to continue to have a high quality government in the longer term \u2013 one that is honest, competent and effective, that is always accountable to the electorate, and that upholds a multi-racial society.\n\nIn Parliament today, I announced 3 things we will do to ensure this:\n\nFirst, we will increase the minimum number of opposition MPs, including Non-Constituency MPs, from 9 to 12 by the next election. We will also give them the same voting rights as MPs. This will in effect aid the opposition, giving their best losers more exposure and possibly building them up for the next round. But I believe this will be good for the government and good for Singapore. No ruling party and government should ever be afraid of open argument. Ultimately, Singapore will benefit from a contest of ideas.\n\nSecond, we will further reduce the average size of Group Representation Constituencies, and create more Single Member Constituencies. The GRC scheme ensures that we will always have at least a minimum number of minority race MPs in Parliament. But we have to find the right balance between big and small GRCs, and the right mix of GRCs and SMCs.\n\nThird, we will review the elected President scheme \u2014 to keep the eligibility criteria up to date, to strengthen the Council of Presidential Advisors (CPA) which assists and advises the President, and to ensure that minorities have a chance to be elected President.\n\nYou can view my full speech here: http:\/\/bit.ly\/20stbdh\n\n- LHL","story":null},{"created_time":"2016-01-29T11:31:33.000Z","id":"125845680811480_1041396192589753","message":"Went #jalanjalan in Chinatown last Saturday to soak up the Lunar New Year buzz.

Mr S Rajaratnam recruited him to join the PAP. KC fought in the 1959 elections and won, thus beginning his long career in politics and the Public Service. \n \nMr Lee Kuan Yew once described KC as a man who \u201chad it\u201d \u2014 a man of courage that did not melt under pressure. In the early 1960s when the PAP was battling pro-communist factions in the party, the pro-communists targeted KC. He received a letter with a bullet, a death threat. In 1961, thousands of Chinese school students staged sit-ins. They threw rotten apples at him and shouted, \u201c\u674e\u70af\u624d, \u8fdb\u68fa\u6750 (Lee Khoon Choy, enter the coffin)!\u201d KC did not buckle. He stood with the PAP and was loyal till the end.\n \nKC also served as Ambassador and High Commissioner to eight countries. As Ambassador to Indonesia, he played a crucial role in thawing relations between Singapore and Indonesia. Singapore had hanged two Indonesian commandos who bombed MacDonald House in 1965 and killed innocent civilians. KC persuaded Mr Lee Kuan Yew to wear a batik shirt and scatter flowers at the graves of the two men in Jakarta. This conciliatory gesture enabled Mr Lee to establish a relationship with President Suharto. In recognition of his contributions, KC was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in 1990.  \n\nAfter KC stepped down from public service, he returned to his first love \u2014 writing and painting. I was honoured to launch his book \u201cGolden Dragon and Purple Phoenix\u201d in 2013. \n\nKC believed that \u201cevery human being should know his own roots. A tree without roots cannot grow. Human beings are the same.\u201d Indeed, as we remember his life, we remember our roots and what our pioneers like him did, to put Singapore on the path it is today. My deepest condolences to his family and loved ones. \u2013 LHL\n \n[At the launch of Mr Lee Khoon Choy\u2019s (far right) book \u201cGolden Dragon and Purple Phoenix\u201d in July 2013. \/ ST Photo \u00a9 Singapore Press Holdings Limited.

One point she made struck me: quite apart from financial incentives and practical considerations, a country\u2019s Total Fertility Rate (TFR) depends also on historical and social factors, which are often not well understood. \n\nShe gave the example of France, which has a TFR of 2.0 \u2014 one of the highest among developed countries. France has good social policies to support and encourage parenthood. But when Josephine visited France to study their experience, all the people she met gave one more explanation: \"1945\". France lost so many of its citizens in the Second World War (600,000 dead) that after the War ended in 1945, there was a strong desire - a national psyche - to repopulate the nation.\n\nThe TFR is a statistic, but it is made up of countless individual stories. I was reminded of the late Congressman Tom Lantos whom I met years ago. He was a Hungarian Jew and Holocaust survivor. He lost most of his family in the concentration camps. After the War, he emigrated to the US and became a Congressman. He had two daughters and 18 grandchildren. His daughters decided to give him as many grandchildren as they could, to make up for the family members killed.\n\nSingapore is fortunate not to have experienced such calamities. Our TFR was 1.25 last year. We should do all we can to encourage couples to have more kids. Hence the enhancements to paternity leave, shared parental leave, and adoption leave that Josephine announced. They come into effect next year, so if you are thinking of having a baby (or another baby), now is the time to start trying! :) - LHL\n\n#SGBudget2016\n\n(Families enjoying a day out at Marina Barrage \/ Photo by me)","story":null},{"created_time":"2016-04-16T03:41:46.000Z","id":"125845680811480_1096358420426863","message":"Arrived in Amman yesterday evening.

With the global economy slowing down, many workers are worried and anxious. This is an issue in Singapore too, with retrenchment a reality for some. We are watching this closely, and have measures to help workers retrain and find new jobs. \n\nOne scheme is the Career Support Programme (CSP), proposed by Minister Lim Swee Say. The CSP provides wage support for a year, to defray hiring costs and encourage employers to try hiring PMETs who have been retrenched mid-career, and hopefully employ them longer-term. \n\nAnother measure is to help our workers upgrade and uplift themselves. Secretary General Chan Chun Sing told me NTUC intends to raise $50 million to partner universities to teach new skills to mid-career workers, including PMETs. I told him if he can raise $50 million, the government will write the cheque for another $150 million, for a total of $200 million in the NTUC-Education and Training Fund. NTUC will start by partnering with NTU, with more universities later down the road.  \n\nIn these are times of rapid change, we must take our challenges seriously, but we should have confidence. The Government and Labour Movement are ready, and with the people\u2019s support for our programmes, we can emerge stronger than before. \n\nClick here to view my May Day Rally Speech: http:\/\/bit.ly\/1W0F8aW \u2013 LHL\n\n#mdrsg\n#CareFairGrow","story":"Lee Hsien Loong added 4 new photos to the album: May Day Rally 2016."},{"created_time":"2016-05-02T02:36:19.000Z","id":"125845680811480_1107547412641297","message":"#guesswhere I was yesterday?

He also was a keen supporter of the Russia-Singapore Business Forum.\n\nSo I am very happy to continue building on our good relations. Our trade has almost quadrupled in the last ten years. But in absolute size, it is still not huge. \n\nThat is why Singapore signed an MOU with the Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC) yesterday. I hope this will pave the way for an FTA between Singapore and the region. \n\nBeyond trade, today we signed two MOUs: one between the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth - MCCY and the Russian Ministry of Culture, and the other between Nanyang Technological University, Singapore and the Russian Academy of Sciences.\n\nWe should work at our cooperation, and have something to show by our 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations in 2018! \u2013 LHL\n\n(ST Photo \u00a9 Singapore Press Holdings.

German parents believe in giving their children the space for adventurous play \u2014 to explore, climb, build, and in the process, develop a sense of \u201cselbstst\u00e4ndigkeit\u201d or self-sufficiency. \n\nThe article describes how in the US (and I suspect in Singapore too), playgrounds are less challenging because parents are more protective of their kids. But it is good for children to learn through exploration and risk taking, and to take a few tumbles in the process. They will grow up more confident and resilient, better able to cope with unfamiliar or difficult situations. \n\nI asked the Housing & Development Board about this, because HDB builds many playgrounds in our housing estates. HDB tells me that they are trying out more interesting designs, like a forest-themed playground in Bukit Panjang, and a military-inspired design in Choa Chu Kang (where Keat Hong Camp used to be). I hope these will be popular with children and their parents, and will lead us to create many more fun spaces for kids! - LHL","story":null},{"created_time":"2016-06-22T02:00:39.000Z","id":"125845680811480_1140856889310349","message":"When was the last time you read a good book?

But recently I have read several good books:\n\nAri Shavit\u2019s My Promised Land: The Triumph and Tragedy of Israel, tells the story of Israel\u2019s nation building and the conflict with the Palestinians through personal stories.\n\nOperation Thunderbolt, by Saul David, is about the spectacular Israeli commando raid on Entebbe airport in Uganda, to rescue hostages after an aircraft hijacking, which happened exactly 40 years ago.\n\nA Rage for Order, by Robert Worth, is about the Arab Spring, and how things have gone since then. Also told through personal stories, it brings home vividly the passions and struggles that combined to cause the upheavals in the Middle East.\n\nI read these books partly because of my April trip to Jordan, Israel, and the Palestine Territories.\n\nHaving just been on holiday in Japan, and visited the tomb of Tokugawa Ieyasu, the daimyo (warlord) who unified Japan and founded the Tokugawa shogunate, I am now starting on a biography of him. Shogun, the Life of Tokugawa Ieyasu, by A L Sadler, was published long ago in 1937, but promises a fascinating read.\n\nThe National Library Board, Singapore encourages Singaporeans to read more, read widely and read together.

It reflects the anxiety of the British population over immigration, their resentment at having to negotiate with and accommodate European partners, and their desire to assert British identity and sovereignty. \n\nOther developed countries also face similar challenges as Britain. We all live in a globalised, interdependent world. The desire to disengage, to be less constrained by one\u2019s partners, to be free to do things entirely as one chooses, is entirely understandable. And yet in reality for many countries disengaging and turning inwards will likely lead to less security, less prosperity, and a dimmer future.\n\nThe next few years will be uncertain ones for Britain and Europe. Leaving the EU is as complicated as joining it. What new arrangements will be made? Will Brexit hurt investor confidence more broadly, and the global economy? How will Britain\u2019s leaving affect the rest of the EU? How will this affect us, living in Asia but part of the same globalised world?\n\nIt is too early to tell, but we need to watch developments carefully. Nobody can foresee all the consequences of the Brexit. \n\nThe British voters have decided. We wish Britain well.

With determination and fire in the belly, he has shown a new generation of aspiring athletes that dreams are worth striving for.  \n\nAchievements, too, are more than medals. Many of our athletes have come away from the Olympics with new personal bests, and valuable experience going up against the world\u2019s best. Swimmer Quah Zheng Wen set two new personal bests in the pool. Rower Saiyidah Aisyah (Aisyah Rower) reached the quarterfinals, finishing as 3rd best Asian competitor.

He used his fortune in royalties to set up a scientific lab that is developing green batteries and a hydrogen powered engine.\n\nJohnson\u2019s story is especially remarkable, as he is an African American who grew up in the American South in the 1960s, when blacks were still discriminated against and downtrodden. But he had a natural sense of curiosity and a \u201cnever-say-die\u201d attitude, and he made it. \n\nHe also spoke of why we must expose the young to ideas, and let them experience success.

Beliau berharap masyarakat Melayu\/Islam akan merebut pelbagai peluang untuk meningkatkan kemahiran dan taraf kehidupan melalui SkillsFuture.\n\nPM juga menyentuh tentang ancaman keganasan yang semakin meruncing dan berbahaya di Singapura. Singapura terkenal sebagai negara yang berbilang agama dan rakyatnya bertolak ansur serta menghormati agama lain. Namun ada kalanya, pendakwah asing tidak faham konteks berbilang bangsa Singapura dan cuba memecahbelahkan keharmonian kaumnya. PM mengalu-alukan inisiatif masyarakat Melayu\/Islam untuk memperkukuhkan Skim Pengiktirafan Asatizah (ARS) dan menjadikannya wajib bagi semua asatizah di Singapura. PM menyambut baik usaha dan azam masyarakat Melayu\/Islam. Ini juga memberi jaminan dan meningkatkan keyakinan bahawa semua asatizah dapat membimbing pelajar mereka untuk mengamalkan Islam sesuai dengan konteks berbilang kaum Singapura.\n\nSebelum mengakhiri ucapannya, PM juga menarik perhatian kepada sistem Presiden Dipilih yang sedang diperhalusi untuk memberi peluang kepada kaum minoriti menjadi Presiden dari masa ke masa. Dengan keyakinan dan sokongan padu, barulah Presiden dapat melaksanakan peranan untuk menyatupadukan rakyat Singapura. \n\nMenggulung ucapannya, PM menekankan bahawa masyarakat Melayu\/Islam adalah anggota penting yang telah banyak menyumbang kepada kesejahteraan dan kemajuan Singapura. Beliau menyeru masyarakat Melayu supaya meraikan kepelbagaian dan bersatu hati supaya dapat terus menikmati keharmonian, kemajuan dan kemakmuran pada masa akan datang.  \n\nTonton video ucapan PM di

These measures will ensure that all asatizah in Singapore understand how Islam is practised there, and can guide their students to live in harmony with fellow Singaporeans of all races and religions.\n\n#ndrsg","story":null},{"created_time":"2016-08-21T13:06:48.000Z","id":"125845680811480_1183569881705716","message":"Q3: HOW DO WE ENSURE GOOD POLITICS FOR SINGAPORE?\n\nPM Lee: I have described some of our strategies to ensure that we progress together and to keep our place in the world. But for all these plans to work, Singapore must have good politics. If our political system malfunctions; if we fail to produce good leaders; if we cannot work together, and are divided among ourselves; then all our best laid plans will come to naught.\n\nThe Brexit referendum was a vivid reminder of the importance of good politics. The vote for the UK to leave the EU is already affecting the UK economy. But the bigger impact of the referendum was to deepen fault lines in British society. Why did it happen? Voters lost faith in their leaders and the whole political class. Large segments of the population felt that they were not benefitting from the country\u2019s progress.\n\nThe same thing can happen here. Can Singapore be different? Yes, provided we have politics that unite the people and uphold our multi-racial society. Our leaders must be attuned to people\u2019s aspirations and respond to their concerns, and our political system must be sound.\n\n#ndrsg","story":null},{"created_time":"2016-08-21T13:08:26.000Z","id":"125845680811480_1183570378372333","message":"REVIEW OF THE ELECTED PRESIDENCY\n\nPM Lee: We have a good political, parliamentary system inherited from the British. We have adapted it over time to fit our needs, and one major change we made was to make the President an elected office. The President is the Head of State and the symbol of the nation. Therefore instead of being chosen by Parliament, he has to be elected by the people of Singapore.\n\nWe have operated this two-key system for 25 years, and made many adjustments to it. But some aspects have not been revised and we need to bring them up to date.\n\nIn January I appointed a Constitutional Commission, chaired by the Chief Justice, to review 3 things:\n  - To consider how the President can give more weight to the advice of the Council of Presidential Advisors (CPA)\n  - To update the criteria for someone to be a candidate to be President\n  - To ensure that minorities regularly have a chance to become President\n\nThe Commission submitted its report to me last week and made recommendations for improvement in all 3 areas. We are still studying the report and will release it soon.\n\nTonight, I won\u2019t talk about specific recommendations by the Commission. I want to explain why we are reviewing the Elected Presidency and to tell you why in these 3 areas we should make changes.\n\n#ndrsg","story":null},{"created_time":"2016-08-21T13:09:10.000Z","id":"125845680811480_1183570795038958","message":"First, strengthening the role of the Council of Presidential Advisors (CPA).\n\nWhen we designed the system, we had in mind not just an elected President, the person elected by voters, but a President advised by a Council of Presidential Advisors. So that when the President makes decisions, he will have the benefit of the collective experience and judgement of the CPA.\n\nWe envisaged that over time, as the CPA became more established, we would build it up further. The CPA arrangements have worked well. The changes proposed to the CPA are incremental and straightforward.\n\n#ndrsg","story":null},{"created_time":"2016-08-21T13:13:46.000Z","id":"125845680811480_1183571138372257","message":"The second issue to review is the qualifying criteria to become a candidate for President. The main purpose of the elected President scheme is to give the President the mandate to decide on two major matters: reserves and appointments. \n\nThe President who safeguards reserves and men must have the right experience to decide whether the Government\u2019s budgets and spending proposals are sound and justified. He must also be able to judge character, motivation, integrity, ability of names put up, and to know what advice to seek and accept.\n\nThat is why candidates must meet the qualifying criteria before they stand for election as President. Candidates must have held key appointments in the public service like Speaker, Chief Justice, Ministers, Permanent Secretaries, or had experience in the private sector running large and complex companies like Singtel, DBS and Keppel Corp. The Constitution defines these as companies with $100mil paid up capital.\n\nBut this $100mil paid up capital criteria is out of date. When we set it 25 years ago, our economy was much smaller, and our reserves too. Now our economy has grown, government spending and reserves have increased.\n\nThe benchmark companies which we had in mind when setting the qualifying criteria have also grown much larger. Running a $100mil company is no longer commensurate with the responsibilities of the President, so we have to update the definition.\n\n#ndrsg","story":null},{"created_time":"2016-08-21T13:31:50.000Z","id":"125845680811480_1183656555030382","message":"PMO Statement: PM Lee took ill while speaking at the National Day Rally.

They comprise Tamil Muslims originally from Kadayanallur, a city in Tamil Nadu close to the southernmost tip of India. Weavers by trade, many left in search of a better life after British textile mills began exporting cheap textiles to India, putting them out of business. \n\nSome sailed to Malacca and Penang (and set up Kadayanallur associations there as well). Many arrived in Singapore with little more than the clothes on their back. They became labourers at the port, and sold wet ground spices for curries. \n\nToday, many have become successful professionals. They have made Singapore their home for three generations or more, just as so many others have done. \n\nThe Tamil Muslim community in Singapore is small \u2013 about 20,000 \u2013 but have woven their own distinctive strand into our multicultural tapestry.

Mr Fong was a convenor of People\u2019s Action Party when it was founded in 1954. Mr Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s team was almost wholly English-educated, and Mr Fong, together with Mr Lim Chin Siong, acted as a bridge to reach the Chinese-educated, the trade unions and the workers.\n\nIn 1956, Mr Fong was detained for his part in a series of strikes and riots that paralysed the island. Mr Lee acted as his lawyer. I remember following my father on a police boat to visit Mr Fong and the other detainees on St John\u2019s Island. My mother would bring a pot of chicken curry and freshly baked bread for them.\n\nLater, Mr Fong followed Mr Lim Chin Siong to break away from the PAP and form the Barisan Sosialis. The fight was over the fundamental issue of Singapore\u2019s future: whether Singapore should be a non-Communist, democratic state, or a Communist one.\n\nMr Lee recalled in his obituary note on Mr Lim Chin Siong in February 1996 that his differences with Mr Lim were ideological and deep, but never personal. He would have said the same of Mr Fong. \n\nThey met for the last time in September 2009, at the launch of the book \u201cMen in White\u201d, a history of the PAP. The two shook hands warmly, and took a photo together.\n\nMy deepest condolences to Mrs Fong and family for their loss. \u2013 LHL\n\n(Mr Fong and Mr Lee during the book launch of \u201cMen in White\u201d in 2009. \/ ZB Photo \u00a9 Singapore Press Holdings Limited.

Two ministers \u2013 Chan Chun Sing and Masagos Zulkifli \u2013 spoke about this in Parliament yesterday. They explained why water is an existential issue for Singapore, and why this price increase is unavoidable. \n\nSingapore is an island, yet we are one of the most water-stressed countries in the world. We have enough water today only because of our unremitting efforts since independence. For us, water will always be a strategic resource, and a matter of national security. The Pioneer Generation knew this. So do the generations of servicemen and women who have defended Singapore. \n\nIn this situation, we have to price water properly. Then every time we turn on the tap, we are conscious of how precious each drop is. We last revised water prices in 1997 \u2013 a long time ago. Since then we have developed NEWater. We have also invested in desalination, which is cheaper than before but still expensive. We need to build more NEWater and desalination plants. That is why the cost of producing water has gone up, and tariffs must rise.\n\nWe should see the 30% increase in perspective. Many households will get additional U-Save rebates. So 1- and 2-room HDB households will not see any nett increase at all. For most other HDB flats, the nett increase will only be between $2 to $11 per month. For three quarters of businesses, water bills will go up by less than a $1 per day ($25 per month). Minister Masagos shared these in his speech (http:\/\/bit.ly\/2lVvdXs) yesterday.\n\nI hope this public debate reminds us how important and valuable water is, and how we can all help to conserve water, so that we always have enough water in Singapore. \u2013 LHL","story":null},{"created_time":"2017-03-03T05:19:28.000Z","id":"125845680811480_1383727198356649","message":"If you missed the telecast of my BBC HARDtalk interview last Wednesday, here is the podcast of the full interview.\n\nStarhub TV subscribers can watch the video on BBC Player from 6 March onwards.\n\nIf you happen to be in the UK now, you can also watch it on the BBC website (bbc.in\/2lFnH0p).\n\nThe full transcript of the interview is available here: bit.ly\/2m0wPiE. \u2013 LHL","story":null},{"created_time":"2017-03-04T10:03:09.000Z","id":"125845680811480_1384904701572232","message":"By international standards, our Parliament is less dramatic than some others, but the quality of our debate is high. \n\nThis week many government MPs have spoken, offering criticisms, seeking explanations, championing passionate causes.

Had he been less steadfast, Singapore might have turned out very differently. \n\nFrom 1963-1965, Singapore was part of Malaysia. Malay PAP leaders came under intense pressure to abandon multiracialism and choose race over nation. They were abused, threatened, and denounced. UMNO leaders held rallies in Singapore, and made fiery speeches personally targeting Mr Lee Kuan Yew and Encik Othman. \n\nIn 1964, racial riots broke out during a procession to mark Prophet Muhammad\u2019s birthday. Encik Othman was there, and witnessed the violence first-hand. But he and his Malay PAP comrades stood firm. They kept the dream of a multi-racial society alive. That is why today we can say with pride, \u201cWe, the citizens of Singapore\u2026 regardless of race, language or religion.\u201d \n\nDuring Mr Lee Kuan Yew\u2019s 75th birthday dinner in 1998, he paid tribute to his old comrade and friend, Encik Othman:\n\n\u201cOthman, I remember your staunch support and loyalty during those troubled days when we were in\nMalaysia and the tensions were most severe immediately before and following the bloody riots in July 1964. At that time, the greatest pressures were mounted by UMNO Malay extremists who denounced you and Malay PAP leaders, especially you, as infidels (kafirs) and traitors (khianats) not to Singapore but to the Malay race. I heard it, the crowd said it, bunches of them, they were designed to intimidate you and the other Malay leaders in PAP. Because of the courage and leadership you showed, not one PAP Malay leader wavered (in 1965) ... That made the difference to Singapore.\u201d\n\nEncik Othman\u2019s determination and courage did indeed make all the difference to Singapore. \n\nYou can view my full eulogy here: http:\/\/bit.ly\/2onAYvy\n\n\u2013 LHL\n\n#RememberingOthmanWok \n \n(Video by Channel NewsAsia) \n\n------- \n\nMalam ini, kita memperingati seorang anak watan Singapura yang hebat, Encik Othman Wok.\n \nEncik Othman sangat percaya dan komited terhadap dasar berbilang bangsa dan agama di Singapura. Kalaulah dia kurang tegas, nasib Singapura mungkin sangat berbeza.\n \nDari 1963-1965, Singapura adalah sebahagian daripada Malaysia. Pemimpin Melayu PAP berdepan dengan tekanan hebat untuk menyingkirkan dasar berbilang bangsa dan mengutamakan bangsa daripada negara. Mereka diugut dan dikutuk. Pemimpin UMNO mengadakan rapat-rapat umum di Singapura dan membuat ucapan berapi-api yang menyasarkan Encik Lee Kuan Yew dan Encik Othman.\n \nPada 1964, rusuhan kaum tercetus semasa perarakan sempena Maulidur Rasul. Encik Othman berada di situ dan menyaksikan sendiri keganasan secara langsung. Tetapi beliau dan pemimpin  Melayu PAP lain tetap berdiri teguh. Mereka gigih berusaha membentuk sebuah Negara berbilang bangsa yang diimpi-impikan. Itulah sebabnya hari ini kita mampu berkata dengan bangganya, \"Kami, warganegara Singapura ... tidak kira apa bangsa, bahasa atau agama.\"\n \nPada 1998, semasa jamuan ulang tahun ke 75 Encik Lee Kuan Yew, beliau memberi penghormatan kepada rakan seperjuangannya, Encik Othman:\n \n\"Othman, saya masih ingat, sokongan padu dan kesetiaan anda semasa waktu-waktu sukar Singapura ketika kita bersama Malaysia dan ketegangan yang amat mencabar sebelum dan sesudah rusuhan berdarah pada Julai 1964. Pada masa itu, golongan pelampau UMNO mengutuk pasukan Melayu PAP sebagai kafir dan pengkhianat, bukan terhadap Singapura tetapi terhadap orang Melayu. Saya dengar kata-kata itu, disuarakan kumpulan-kumpulan yang sengaja mahu menakut-nakutkan anda dan pemimpin Melayu PAP. Kerana keberanian dan kepimpinan anda, tidak seorangpun pemimpin Melayu PAP yang patah semangat...

Had a lovely time with Ang Mo Kio GRC and Sengkang West SMC residents of all races at Pesta Lebaran 2017 this morning. Our Malay friends came dressed in their best baju kurung. Everyone enjoyed familiar Hari Raya tunes, upbeat performances, and of course, yummy food. :)\n\nMy thanks to the The People's Association\u2019s Malay Activity Executive Committees Council (MESRA) and AMK GRC\u2019s Malay Activities Executive Committees (MAECs) for organising the event. Congrats too to MESRA and all MAECs on their 40th Anniversary! Do continue your good work of bonding residents through activities for many years to come.\n\nSelamat Hari Raya to all! \u2013 LHL\n\n==========\n \nGembira sekali dapat bersama-sama para penduduk kawasan Ang Mo Kio GRC and Sengkang West SMC berbilang kaum di \u201cPesta Lebaran\u201d pagi tadi. Sambutan Syawal masih hangat dirasai. Rakan-rakan Melayu kita semuanya kelihatan cantik dan segak dengan baju kurung yang berwarna-warni. Ramai juga keluarga yang datang mengenakan baju kurung sedondon! Saya juga senang sekali melihat semua yang hadir begitu ramah dengan satu sama lain dan seronok menikmati makanan lazat dan persembahan yang penuh bertenaga.\n\nTerima kasih kepada Majlis Eksekutif Aktiviti Melayu (MESRA) dan Jawatankuasa Eksekutif Kegiatan Melayu (MAEC) GRC Ang Mo Kio yang telah bergading bahu menganjurkan acara ini. Tahniah juga kepada MESRA dan semua MAEC atas ulangtahun ke-40 tahun ini.

They came from all walks of life. Signing up was a leap of faith, and no small commitment. But they served loyally and wholeheartedly, and contributed greatly to building the SAF. As pioneers, their careers and experiences were unique. They truly deserve to be called \u2018One of a Kind\u2019!  \n\nGreatly honoured to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of the first SAFTI Commissioning Parade with the First Batch officers last night. For half a century, they have been meeting every year on the anniversary \u2013 July 16th. It testifies to the depth of their friendship and camaraderie.  \n\nSingapore owes a debt of gratitude to the First Batch officers. I wish you many more happy gatherings!

But the recent arrests of 3 self-radicalised Singaporeans \u2013 one infant care assistant and two auxiliary police officers \u2013 bring the threat home in a vivid and sobering way. \n\nHad a candid dialogue with the Muslim community and religious leaders yesterday. They shared their concerns, and suggested ways to strengthen ties among the communities, and to counter radicalisation.\n\nThe terrorism threat to Singapore is at its highest level in recent years. We must remain vigilant in fighting religious extremism. More importantly, we must maintain trust and confidence among our communities. \n\nNext week I will hold another dialogue, this time with community and religious leaders of all faiths, to discuss the same issue. \u2013 LHL\n\n=====\nSerangan-serangan pengganas di London, Paris, Brussels dan Australia mungkin kelihatan jauh. Namun, penahanan 3 rakyat Singapura yang terjebak dalam kegiatan radikal - seorang penolong pengasuh penjagaan bayi dan dua pegawai polis tambahan \u2013 baru-baru ini sangat membimbangkan. Ternyata ancaman pengganasan semakin dekat dengan kita. \n\nSaya berbincang tentang perkara ini dengan para pemimpin masyarakat dan agama Islam semalam. Kami berbicara secara jujur dan terus terang. Selain berkongsi kebimbangan mereka mengenai isu ini, para hadirin juga menyuarakan cara-cara untuk mengukuhkan ikatan di kalangan masyarakat dan membasmi ancaman radikalisasi.\n\nAncaman serangan pengganas bukan saja wujud di Singapura, malah kini di tahap paling tinggi. Kita mesti lebih waspada dan teruskan perjuangan kita menghapuskan kegiatan radikal. Lebih penting lagi, kita tidak boleh membiarkannya menggugat kepercayaan dan keyakinan di kalangan masyarakat di sini. \n\nMinggu depan, saya akan bertemu pula dengan para pemimpin berbilang masyarakat dan agama untuk membincangkan isu yang sama. \u2013 LHL","story":"Lee Hsien Loong added 2 new photos to the album: Community Engagement with Malay-Muslim Leaders."},{"created_time":"2017-07-18T14:06:20.000Z","id":"125845680811480_1544857938910240","message":"Spent the morning with a much younger crowd than usual. :) Visited the MOE Kindergarten @ Punggol View and My First Skool at Edgefield Plains. Both serve many young families in the Punggol area.\n\nThe schools have found creative ways to make best use of limited space. The MOE Kindergarten is right next to Punggol View Primary School, and the two share facilities. My First Skool is built on the fifth level of a multi-storey carpark.\n\nPreschool is an important time when the child lays the foundation of his future learning and development. Children learn best through play, so I am happy that both centres offer holistic education and lots of hands-on activities.

She was undaunted by the challenge, and discharged her duties with grace and poise. She touched many with her quiet determination, humility, and charm. During the tumultuous years of our nation-building, especially in those dark days of racial riots and Separation, she helped Encik Yusof be a unifying figure for all Singaporeans. \n\nVery happy to launch her biography \u201cPuan Noor Aishah: Singapore\u2019s First Lady\u201d.
